    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tu Register form</li>
            <p>It's a task that the teacher ordered as a group task to make a web page to fill out a form. I am responsible for doing the front end. The first thing I do is design the web page using figma in the finished design and bring the design to be written in the Program vscode using html and css to decorate, then commit the code written to gitlab. The result is that the job is done on time because of good planning and work that is exactly as designed.</p>
            <li>Line Chat Bot Movie Suggestion</li>
            <p>It is an assignment from the AI subject where the teacher asked me to create a chat bot that could be related to anything. I have the duty to find basic chat information, because I have no one before, so I concluded that I would use the LINE messaging api and Dialogue to do it by basic work, which is to put Keyword. to a bot such as adventure in the dialogue flow if the user types If you want to watch an adventure movie, the chatbot will recommend the movies listed in the database. But. There are still many bugs, probably because everyone has done it for the first time, so they learned how to do basic chatting, but have to study more to make the next work more quality.</p>
